Message: You're interested in changing sections? That's definitely possible! You can fill out the petition form for a section change, but just make sure that the new section you want has available seats first. We wouldn't want you to go through the process only to find out there isn't space available. Is that something you'd like to explore further?

Message: Hello! I'm happy to help you with your query about VME. The Vincent Mary School of Engineering (VME) at ABAC University has many excellent instructors. While it's subjective to determine who is the "best," I can suggest that you check out our faculty directory or course catalog to learn more about each professor's expertise and teaching style.

If you're looking for recommendations, we have a number of highly-regarded professors in various departments within VME. However, without more specific information about your interests or areas of study, it's hard for me to make a recommendation. Would you like some suggestions based on our course offerings?
